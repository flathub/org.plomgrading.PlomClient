# org.plomgrading.PlomClient: Flatpak support

This a Flatpak manifest for the [Plom](https://plomgrading.org) Client.


## Credits

For the python dependencies, I use [flatpak-pip-generator] and [req2flatpak].

[flatpak-pip-generator]: https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak-builder-tools/blob/master/pip/flatpak-pip-generator
[req2flatpak]: https://johannesjh.github.io/req2flatpak/main/index.html


## Maintenance

I bump the deps according to the upstream `requirements.txt` file.
For example,
```
./flatpak-pip-generator appdirs==1.4.4 --yaml
req2flatpak --requirements \
    platformdirs==4.3.6 \
    --target-platforms "311-x86_64 311-aarch64 312-x86_64 312-aarch64" \
    --outfile python3-platformdirs.yaml
```
For `requests-toolbelt`, `flatpak-pip-generator` tends to re-order the entries.
So I somewhat do that one manually based on the output.

Note: `python3-packaging`, `python3-tomli` are in `com.riverbankcomputing.PyQt.BaseApp`.

Then I submit a branch to github.com, which causes the Flathub bot to try
building it.  It also gives you a link that folks can use if they need a
new version in a hurry.
